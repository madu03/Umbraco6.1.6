<p>The Simple Starter Kit gives you a bare-bones website that
introduces you to a set of well-defined conventions for building an
Umbraco website.</p>

<p>The Simple website is very basic in form and provided without
any design or functionality - unless you add a Skin, of course. By
installing the Simple Starter Kit, you'll begin with a minimal site
built on best practices. You'll also enjoy the benefits of speaking
the same "language" as the rest of the Umbraco community by using
common properties and naming conventions.</p>

<p>Now that you know what the Simple site is, it is time to get
started using Umbraco.</p>
