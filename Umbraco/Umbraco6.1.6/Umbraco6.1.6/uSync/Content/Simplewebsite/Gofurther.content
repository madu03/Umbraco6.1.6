<p>The Simple Starter Kit only scratches the surface of what's
possible with Umbraco. Below the Simple Starter Kit and its modules
lies a great architecture that lets you implement whatever you
need.</p>

<p>With Umbraco you've finally got a solid, open and reliable
platform for websites as basic as the Simple site, and Umbraco can
be rapidly expanded to support multi-language websites,
collaboration platforms and intra/extranets, to name just a
few.</p>

<p>Advanced functionality is created with Umbraco macros, built
with XSLT and Umbraco's award-winning .NET integration, including
full support for any .NET User or Custom control. Create and
integrate your own .NET macros in mere minutes with point and click
simplicity. Simply copy your controls to the Umbraco website, go to
the <strong>Developer</strong> section and create a new macro,
selecting your control from the list.</p>

<p>You can also use <a

 title="Working with Razor">Microsoft's Razor</a> syntax to quickly
add dynamic functionality to your site.</p>

<p>We've also gathered the best community macros into a repository
that's also accessed from the <strong>Developer</strong> section,
in the <strong>Packages</strong> area. You can find more
information <a
